# Anaphora Resolution
#
# see: https:#www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/L104/lec12-2x2.pdf
# Two different operations are performed:
#
# Maintaining and updating a discourse model consisting of a set of co-reference classes:
# * Each co-reference class corresponds to one entity that has been evoked in the discourse
# * Each co-reference class has an updated salience value
#
# Resolving each Pronoun from left to right
# * Collect potential referents from up to 4 sentences back
# * Filter out coreference classes that donâ€™t satisfy  agreement/syntax constraints
# * Select remaining co-reference class with the highest salience value; add pronoun to class.
#
# The salience of a referent is calculated on the basis of recency and grammatical function.
# Salience Factor        Example                          Weight
# Current sentence                                          100
# Subject emphasis       John opened the door                80
# Existential emphasis   There was a dog standing outside    70
# Accusative emphasis    John liked the dog                  50
# Indirect object        John gave a biscuit to the dog      40
# Adverbial emphasis     Inside the house, the cat looked on 50
# Head Noun emphasis     The cat in the house looked on      80

# The salience of a referent is the sum of all applicable weights
# The salience of a referent is halved each time a sentence  boundary is crossed
# This, along with the weight for being in the current sentence,  makes more recent referents more salient
# Weights are calculated for each member of the salience class
# Previous mentions can boost the salience of a coreference class
# This accounts for the repetition effect
# Lappin and Leass report 86% accuracy for their algorithm on a corpus of Computer manuals
